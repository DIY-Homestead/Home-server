Home server repository
======================

There is many tasks on a homestead, lots of which we all use different systems to help with. This project is created to collect free and useful software and help people setting them up.

Main focus points are
---------------------

* The software must be free (Homesteaders are normally not rich people, and we want to be inclusive).
* The components should be structured with minimal dependencies (Users should be able to cherrypick by their needs).

Basics
------

* The test server and references will be tested and documented for the latest LTS release of Ubuntu server (Linux with no gui). However, support for other systems are encouraged!
* Any interested person are welcome to join, regardless of skills. Developers, Sys admins, designers, enthusiasts and more :)
* Discussions, inspiration, examples, chatting etc on Discord: https://discord.gg/KPxBaVg

Documentation can be found in the [doc](doc/readme.md) directory.
