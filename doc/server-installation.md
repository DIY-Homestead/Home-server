Server installation
===================

Many of the services will probably run great on a cloud server somewhere, this documentation is for those people that want to have their own home server.

Pros
* If you plan to use ip-cameras or use this for document storage (especially large documents, like videos) you do not have to worry about your bandwidth or bandwidth limitations at a hosting company.
* There are no monthly fees.
* You are in control.
* Need more space? Just plug in a new disk.
* You learn a lot.
* It works even if you are offline.
* You may have internal services that are never exposed to the internet.

Cons
* You are responsible for all the security.
* You are responsible for backups.
* You are responsible for all the maintenance.

If you wish to set up your own server, see [Installing Ubuntu server](installing-ubuntu-server.md).
