Home server documentation
=========================

Throughout this documentation, it is assumed that you have your own private, home server with at least 4 cores and 8 GB ram or more. That said, all can probably still be achieved with a different setup with some minor changes to what is documented here.

1. [Server installation](server-installation.md).
2. [Installing VirtualBox](installing-virtualbox.md).
3. [Installing and configuring Ldap](ldap-setup.md).
4. [Setting up nginx proxy](nginx-proxy-setup.md).
5. [Setting up letsencrypt](letsencrypt.md).
